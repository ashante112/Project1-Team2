<b>Introduction:</b>

In general, it has been scientifically demonstrated that physical exercise is tightly correlated with mental acuity. Studies have demonstrated that physically active people are not only healthier but also perform better on tests of cerebral or intellectual ability. Most studies show that the more exercise students get, the more proficient their mental faculties and cerebral performance can become.

<b>Investigation:</b>

Our project will investigate any trends and correlations between sports and academic performance in collegiate programs. We are aware that there are various motivational factors that are established for sports athletes within their programs that may benefit their academic performance.  If possible, we would like to compare their performance with their non-sports peers. In addition, we would like to explore any geographical trends we see in academic performance in a comparative visualization.

We will seek to find data from the NCAA or its underlying affiliates as well as academic records from eligible institutions.

<b>Questions:</b>

Is there a correlation between involvement in NCAA sports and academic achievement?

Is there variation in academic performance by type of sport?

Which sports trend higher academic achievement vs lower?

What outliers exist?  

Are there any geographical correlations we can find?

<b>Data we have found: </b>

We found data which would provide us with NCAA graduation rates as well as academic performance rates with a breakdown by sports program. 

<b>Data we would like to find:</b>

We would like to find data on GPA results that can be broken down by sports programs, and compared with non-sports participants.  We think this may be a challenge, as there does not appear to be academic data collected specifically for non-athletes. Whether we can find a dataset that has GPA data for all collegiate students, with a qualifying selection for NCAA athletic participation remains to be seen.

We are also interested in looking at how students are performing academically in NCAA programs across the nation. We would like to find data that would highlight this from a geo-comparative perspective.
